## First we build the tools, then they build us.

The human species is at the top of the food chain primarily due to two reasons. We were able to transfer knowledge acquired through experience, from one generation to the next. We solved our problems by building remarkable tools and refining them over time.

The tools we deal with today are quite different from those used by our ancestors. Our tools are almost entirely virtual/digital. We are interested in a specific kind of tool that mimics nature. We call them models.  A model could be an approximation of a natural phenonmenon or it could be entirely made up to serve a purpose. Models could be engineered based on knowledge gained from experience.
Or they could be learned entirely from data collected from nature. These are called data-driven models.

We are a group of scientists and engineers, working together to understand the world better and solve real problems using data-driven models.
