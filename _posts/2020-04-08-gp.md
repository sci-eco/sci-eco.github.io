Start out your blog with a simple introduction paragraph. This should contain these things and if possible, in the same order:
- What is the blog is about? Give a short gist of the blog in 1 or 2 sentences.
- If needed, go into some more detail about the topics in the blog.
- Why should the reader be interested in this topic? Why should they spend their time reading this blog?
- Who is the target audience for this blog? What kind of person will benefit the most from reading this blog? For instance, will this blog help a researcher, or is it more for someone trying to learn a topic?
- What will the reader learn or be able to do after reading the blog? For instance, will they be able to create a project, or implement a paper, or use a framework/toolkit?

If applicable (especially when teaching a framework, or a topic), the introductory paragraph should also try to set up a task or test. This task or test should be such that, if the user is able to complete it, then they know that they have learned the content being presented in this blog. For instance, a task could be to fill up a table, or check off items in a list. A test could be a question that tests the readers knowledge on the topic.

### How to create a blog?

There are a few ways you can create a blog:
- If you are using a colab notebook, then you can download that notebook as a `ipython` notebook and then use `jupyter` to convert it to markdown. This will ensure that your markdown will contain both the code and console outputs. Make sure that you format your code with the formatting style mentioned later in this document. This colab notebook must be shared along with the blog.
- If you are not using a colab notebook, and you are writing an article from scratch, then you can start writing it in markdown directly.
- While colab is preferred if you want to show code and output, sometimes you might not be able to use a colab notebook and use a python script instead. In this case, put important parts of your code in the blog (and their corresponding outputs if any). Such a blog must also accompany a github repo with all the code, documentation and any accompanying models or files.

Here are some points to remember when sharing the code:
- The code must be shared in full and should not have any missing pieces. This does not include any secret items though (API tokens for example).
- Code must have instructions on how to get started and should be documented so that it is easy for someone new to the code base to understand it. Think of your code as an extension of your blog.
- If your code generated any files or models, these should be included too.
- If you are using a colab notebook, then it is fine if the notebook does not contain all the text and explanations present in your blog. Remember that the code is an extension of your blog and not the other way around. This means that as long as the code or notebook contains the minimum documentation, but the complete code, then it is fine.

### Writing and publishing your blog

When you are ready to start writing your blog, create a separate branch in the blog repo and start making your changes there. If you want to see how your blog will look like, you can build your branch locally and view it in the browser.

Any images used in the blog should go into the `/images/<name-of-blog>/` folder.

Feel free to push any intermediate work that you might to your branch. Once you feel like your blog is finished, you can ask for it to be reviewed by creating an issue and tagging the relevant reviewers. Once all reviews are done, you are ready to take the final few steps to make your blog public! Firstly, remember to name your file as `<year>-<month>-<day>-<name>.md`. Also remember to add your blog metadata at the top of the blog. Finally, merge your branch with master.

Your blog is now published! Share it on social media: you have worked hard, you deserve the attention!

### Headings and Titles

You should not use the first and second markdown headings. That is, do not use `#` or `##` to create headings. The title of the blog should be present in the layout blurb at the top of the file. For subheadings, use the third heading level or three hashtags `###`. You should not use two hashtags `##` for any headings. For sub-subheadings, feel free to use more that 3 hashtags or bold text.

### Text formatting

Format your text so that it is easy to read and understand. Be creative; What is the best way that you can present the contents of this blog that will help the user understand it?

For instance, key terms can be formatted in **bold** or *italics*. Create pull outs using blockquotes, to reiterate important points made in the text.

> You can also use block quotes for important phrases or quotes.

When listing something, use bullet points:
- These are also useful when summarising key points.
  - You can also use sub-bullet points

1. Or even numbered items
2. Like this one.

When referencing or citing something, use citations [^1]. All citations, should be included at the botton of the blog [^2].

Do not use links to different websites in the middle of the text. Citations [^1] (which can also be repeated) should be used instead. However, if a link is absolutely necessary, then feel free to use it.

You can use any of the other text formatting options.

### Nice, clean, reading! is always good read

Good clean read is set up with readability first in mind. Whatever you want to communicate here can be read easily, and without distraction. Of course, it's fully responsive, which means people can read it naturally on any phone, or tablet. Write it in markdown in <code>index.md</code> and get a beautifully published piece.

### Syntax Highlighting

When presenting code, or code outputs, use Jekyll syntax highlighting. You can highlight your code by wrapping it within tags like so:

<pre><code>{% raw %}
{% highlight python %}

your code here

{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
</code></pre>

Here is an example of what your code will look like:

{% highlight python %}

import pika


class MessageQueueService(object):

    def log(self, message, queue, host, direction=MessageQueueLog.RECEIVED):
        message_log = MessageQueueLog.objects.create(
                queue=queue,
                host=host,
                message=message,
                direction=direction
            )
        return message_log

{% endhighlight %}

Multiple languages are supported, but some of the common ones you might need are: `python`, `bash`, `console`. You can find an exhaustive list of supported language highlighters [here](https://haisum.github.io/2014/11/07/jekyll-pygments-supported-highlighters/).


### Presenting Code

When you are using code, keep the following points in mind to improve the reader's experience:

- `python`: Use `PEP8` standards [^3] when formatting your code, especially the line length of 79 characters. This makes sure that the reader will not have to scroll to see the whole code
- `bash` or `console`: Similar to python, try to make the lengths of each line be 79 characters or less. This is not strictly enforced as this might not always be possible.

### Font awesome is also included

<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x fa-pull-left fa-border"></i> Now you can use all the cool icons you want! [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) is indeed awesome. But wait, you don't need this sweetness and you don't want that little bit of load time from the font awesome css? No problem, just disable it in the `config.yml` file, and it won't be loaded.

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>you can make lists...</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o"></i>with cool icons like this,</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-spinner fa-spin"></i>even ones that move!</li>
</ul>

If you need them, you can stick any of the [605 icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) anywhere, with any size you like. ([See documentation](http://fontawesome.io/examples/))

<i class="fa fa-building"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-bus fa-lg"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-cube fa-2x"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-paper-plane fa-3x"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-camera-retro fa-4x">

### Add images to make your point

Images play nicely with this template as well. Add diagrams or charts to make your point, and the template will fit them in appropriately.

There are two ways you can include images, either in the form of a table like this:


| ![](/images/hello.svg) |
|------------------------|
| Ah yes, the elusive arrow. Yup, that's an arrow. [source](/images/hello.svg)|

Or like this:

![](/images/hello.svg)
*Ah yes, the elusive arrow. Yup, that's an arrow. [source](/images/hello.svg)*

Images, especially technical ones should have captions. Certain images (like memes, or non-technical images)might not need captions, in which case, you can omit it.

Always remember to give sources for any image that you use (unless created by yourself). Image sources should be present as links at the end of the image caption.

### Add sharing buttons

If you wish, you can also add social sharing buttons in your blog. Try to keep these buttons at the beginning or end of the article, and never in the middle, so as to not interrupt the flow of your article.

Simply add the following line anywhere in your markdown:

<pre><code>{% raw  %}
{% include sharing.html %}
{% endraw %}
</code></pre>

and get a nice responsive sharing ribbon.

{% include sharing.html %}

Add this at the bottom, or the top, or between every other paragraph if you're desprate for social validation.

Just remember to customize the buttons to fit your url in the `_includes/sharing.html` file. These buttons are made available and customizable by the good folks at kni-labs. See the documentation at [https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb](https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb) for more information.

### Conclusion

Conclude your blog, by highlighting what they learnt. This is also where you can link to further learning resources and talk about future works in this area.
